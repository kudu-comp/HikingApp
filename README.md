# onlinehiking
A quick Javascript / Vue app that I build for walking an online hike.

#### The example
The included example is in the Netherlands and is there to give you some ideas.
Just copy everything in a directory and open index.html to start walking.

#### Create your own
To create your own hike fill the tasks array with your assignments
To change how it looks edit main.css.

#### Contents of the hike
The hike is stored in the tasks array. Each task consists of
- an image with the task
- a message with explanation
- a question
- the correct answer.
The question should be answered correctly at the end of the task to be able to proceed
to the next task. You can go back and forward between completed tasks.
